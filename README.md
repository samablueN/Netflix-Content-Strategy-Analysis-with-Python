# 🎬 Netflix Content Strategy Analysis with Python

## Overview
This project analyses Netflix’s content catalogue to understand how the platform has evolved over time and how its content strategy varies across formats, countries, and genres.

Using Python, the project transforms raw data into clear insights about Netflix’s global expansion, content prioritisation, and market focus. The goal is to demonstrate strong data analytics and storytelling skills through structured analysis and visualisation.

## Business Questions Addressed
The analysis focuses on five key questions:

1. How has Netflix’s content library evolved over time?
2. Does Netflix prioritise Movies or TV Shows?
3. Which countries produce the most Netflix content?
4. What genres dominate Netflix’s catalogue?
5. Does Netflix focus more on recent content releases?

Each question is answered using data cleaning, aggregation, and visual exploration techniques.
